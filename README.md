# STIW3054-Real-Time-Programming
[Markdown Chear Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

In order to learn Real Time Programming, there is some knowledge we need to learn/configure be get start.
-
- **Install openjdk version 8, 11, and 17.** Because the latest version might not widely supported (If not will face problem when exploring NASA project, because some of code can support for certain java version, thats why need to have different java version in laptop for swap different java version faster). [Oracle JDK download Link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk18-archive-downloads.html)
- After install the three version of jdk, find a ways to swap different jdk version faster **(JENV)**. **Will face some problem when installing JENV, just right click on the jenv, click on RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR, and type Y to install jenv, so could start use jenv.** [Jenv Github](https://github.com/FelixSelter/JEnv-for-Windows) [Video for setup and use Jenv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMQ6npCjAks)
- Understand **software design pattern and SOLID principles** in order to produce high quality of writing code. [Software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) [SOLID principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
- Try to download and **explore how to use Docker(Software)** to help understand/learn about **microservice** which would help in this course.
- In this course, learning to create web application using **spring framework/spring boot, JSP and servlet** in order to achieve our project assignment (Spring boot is more popular than Spring). We need to **create two web app for Producer and Consumer**, then will use **Kafka** (Kafka provides a powerful solution to address the challenges of inter-service communication in microservices architectures.) to communicate with in between two web application for exchanging information. Microservices enable two app with different version communicate and exchange information. Kafka is the one of popular and used in IT industry.
- As in lecture class on 15 December 2023, the lecturer say that SDLC such as waterfall, agile and more is just basic stuff. Most IT industry using **DevOps Methodology (integrates and automates)**. Example, a practicum student works in a bank, and she save the project of company in the Google Drive, the system will detect and inform alert that the project of company is not secure any more as what she did. [DevOps info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)
- **RESTful API** is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet.
- In this course, we will learn about **Distributed computing** (the method of making multiple computers work together to solve a common problem). Example why does some large software like Google and GitHub won't down? This is because they spend much money to purchase many machine that backup all the data, so when main machine is down, other machine act as backup to provide information. **Apache Hadoop** enable to help us understand parallel programming and concurrency.
- JPS stands for JAVA PROCESS STATUS (open cmd and key in jps then u can know the status).

Progress/Caution when learning Real Time Programming
-
- Learn to run thread in many computer
- After master every thread, will learn how to communicate between thread
- Line/Network will be challenging, will face many problems

Additional knowledge to know/explore (Lect told in 01/11/2023)
- 
- write a java program to detect how many processor in your computer/machine
- jupyter notebook
- AnacondaNavigator
- Jupyter lab (need to familiar, solve problem faster)
- VS code (This four need to be familar in order to become a software engineer)
- Hadoop application
- hbase is a hadoop database (hbase is good for real time programming and distributed computing)
- See the programming language trends [TIOBE INDEX](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)
- postgres
- hbase is good for real time programming and distributed computing
- dbase - normally create on mainframe/mini computer..not in own desktop like us (AS400)


**The lecturer is very nice and shared with us a lot of information about the latest technologies in the IT industry**
